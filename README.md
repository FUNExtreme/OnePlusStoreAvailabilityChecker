## How to use
* Go to a OnePlus product item page, for example: https://oneplus.net/be_nl/the-basics-plus-bundle
* In the URL bar, you will see an icon that looks similar to the OnePlus logo.
* Click it, and choose "Start checking availability"
* Refresh the page manually
* *NOTE: From this point on the page will refresh every 30 seconds, to check if the item is back in stock. If the item is in stock a beep will play, and a message will display "In Stock". If you are currently browsing in a different tab or instance of Google Chrome the product page will automatically become the visible one (because the message is an Alert). This should be enough to grab your attention*
* At that point you should click the url bar icon again and choose "Stop checking availability", if you don't it will continue its work the next time you visit that product page.

Now go buy your items and enjoy the sales
